                <p>My current research is related to rotating and stable stratified flows. I am working both, numerical and experimentally, in the question of how the energy is transfer through scales by turbulence in these environments. The main motivation to study this process is given by the fact that both the ocean and the atmosphere are rotating and stratified environments. The multiscales transfer of energy is a key process to improve parametrization of climate model which need to take into account the physics happening on sub-grid scales.

                <h4>Energy cascade in stratified and rotating flows</h4>
                <p> Turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere is dominated by stratification and rotation. Understanding how the energy is transported from large eddies to the small dissipative scales would improve the modeling of the unresolved scales in meteorological and oceanic models. We use a stratified tank set on a rotating table and direct numerical simulations to study stratified and rotating turbulence. The turbulence is produced by the interaction of multiple columnar vortices.

                <p> The combination of stratification and rotation produces a particular type of turbulence, with a dual cascade of
energy towards the large scales and small scales where the energy is dissipated. The eddies are large (see horizontal plane) but with a small thickness that induces strong shear and the formation of small scales (see vertical plane).

                <h4>Turbulence mixing in high resolution DNS</h4>
                <img src="img/buoyancy-3d.jpg" width="100%" class="w3-round" alt="img-turbu1">
                <p><i>Figure: Snapshot of a 3D buoyancy field of a turbulent decaying flow with initial linear stratification.</i><br><br>
                Stratified fluids are common to many geophysical and industrial environments. The dynamics of these systems are driven by the complex balance between turbulent decay, buoyancy restoring force and irreversible mixing ; where the local mixing can produce an effect in the global energy budget of the system. <br><br>
                In particular, turbulent mixing in the ocean interior plays a crucial role in its global energy budget. This mixing partially drives large scale dynamics, as evidenced in the meridional overturning circulation (Wunsch and Ferrari (2004)). In addition, vertical transport in the ocean is substantial for sequestering large quantities of dissolved greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. The proportion of energy transferred from turbulent structures to effective mixing is very difficult to estimate through observations (Ivey et al. (2008)), and the details of this energy transfer is yet not fully understood. <br><br>
                In order to resolve irreversible mixing produced by turbulence in a stable stratification, we introduce boundaries at the top and bottom of our domain which allows the mean stratification to evolve in time. This differs with the classical approach of homogeneous stratified turbulence where the background stratification is fixed. The main interest of our approach is that the irreversible mixing is directly computed from the full density field. A porous penalization region is introduced to take into account non-flux conditions at the bottom and at the top of the box.

(b)Vertical profile of the horizontal mean reduced density field (red line) and horizontal mean of the sorted reduced density field (green line). The initial reduced density profile is also indicated (dashed line). The penalization region is indicated by two arrows and the letter P between both figures.</i></p>

                <h4>Internal gravity waves</h4>
                <p>Watch a video of an internal plane wave propagating in experimental conditions <a href="https://youtu.be/1mlF3DR9Rfc">here</a>.</p>
                <p>When difference of density exists within a fluid, it will tend to redistribute driven by the force of gravity so that the lighter fluid remains above the heavier forming a stable stratification profile. This particular configuration will be stable in time and if not perturbed, static. When the fluid is slightly vertically displaced, it will feel a buoyancy restoring force acting in a direction opposite to the displacement. The force will act as a spring, and therefore the fluid will oscillate around an equilibrium position. These oscillations are know as internal gravity waves, which differ from the well known surface waves, as they occur inside the fluid where the density of the fluid changes continuously. <br>
                The atmosphere is stratified in temperature, and the ocean is stratified in both salinity and temperature. The main motivation for understanding the dynamics of internal gravity waves is that they occur naturally in these systems. These waves have an effect over the dynamics of stratify systems, and may be taken into account to be able to better predict large scale effects such as transport of energy and matter.</p>
                <p>Thanks to several experimental techniques internal waves can be generated and observed in laboratory conditions.</p>
                <br><br>

                <p><i>Figure : Velocity field of an internal wave near-critical reflection. The incident wave is coming from left to right, and the generator is located 30 cm from the center of the image.</i></p>
                <p>The peculiar dispersion relation and the nonintuitive relation between group velocity and the wavenumber of internal gravity waves lead to some very unusual physical consequences. In particular, when internal waves are reflected on a sloped boundary the frequency is conserved, and therefore, its angle of propagation. In consequence, nonintuitive effects including reflection, focalization and wave attractors will emerge when internal waves interact with boundaries.</p>
                <p>The detailed study of this process is principally motivated by the peculiar characteristics of internal waves reflection that can enhance the shear stress developed near boundaries and therefore generate erosion of particles settle at a boundary.</p>
                <p>Many observational studies have been done that indicate that internal gravity waves are a cause of sediment resuspension, as for example Bogucki et al 1997., Quaresma et al. 2007 and Hosegood & van Haren 2004. In every case the capacity of generating sediment transport through the interaction of internal waves over the seafloor is limited by the shear stress generated at the boundary and the physical characteristics of the particles</p>
